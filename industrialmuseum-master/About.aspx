                        <h2>LEARN THE MUSEUM’S STORY</h2>
                         <br>
                        <p>In 1977 a group of citizens, businesses and organizations decided to setup the museum to recognize the industrial development done in previous years. The museum officially opened its doors to the public in 1984. At Denmark’s Industrial Museum you can learn about production, living conditions and financial development in Denmark after 1850.</p>
                         <br>
                        <p>The Museum paints an impressive picture of the significant development the industrial society has undergone during the last decades. The museum is situated in the old electricity – and gasworks in Horsens and the exhibits show the development from the earliest industry to the latest technological advances.</p>
                         <br>
                        <p>A special focal point is the differences in living conditions which is illustrated in the exhibit the industrial city, where time typical homes from 1880 to 1998 are on display.</p>

                    <p>The museum has its own "Wardrobe", an in-house rental store, developed with the sole purpose to engage artisans and reenacters, as well as enthusiasts who might want to experience the fashion of this era. Naturally, the wardrobe was inspired by the rich societal history during the late 1800’s.</p>
                     <br>
                    <p>The museum also hosts a number of special exhibitions and live demonstrations in the different workshops that are conducted throughout the year. There is also the ‘Danish Money Museum’, established on the basis of the Savings Bank Museum in Klarskovgaard in cooperation with the financial sector.</p>

                        <h2>LEARN WHAT THE MUSEUM DOES</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>The museum is, via the Museum Act, required to collect, record and preserve cultural heritage for posterity, to research the period, and to disseminate the knowledge gathered to a wider audience. The museum has a large collection of items that particularly highlights developments up to 1960. The museum has also been documenting the development that industrial society has undergone in recent decades.</p>

                     <p>There are a number of collaborations with similar museums nationally and internationally and through the Midtjyske Museers Development Council with the region's other museums. The museum participates in seminars, where museums from across the country with an interest in the industrial field meet and discuss how best to disseminate knowledge to the industry's development. The museum is a member of the Association of specialist museums in Denmark.</p>

                        <h2>BECOME A PART OF THE FAMILY AND SUPPORT US</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are many reasons to support the arts and especially the Industrial Museum. The State and the Horsens Municipality are just a few who support us thoroughly. We have also recieved support from the general central region.</p>
                     <p>Naturally, the expenses of showcasing objects from decades ago, will be high. We’re often seeking funds within the public sector to further support the museum’s mission, which is to develop and contribute to the story of the industry’s development as well as the great progress that has been made in the welfare state, in the last 100 years.</p>

                     <p>Being a sponsor and supporting Industrial Museum not only provides the ability to network with a large group of Danes, it ialso serves as exposure within the media. However, by supporting us,  you could help us greatly so that we can continue to share the stories of those before us.</p>
                      <p>We will continue to work to make viable sponsorships, and the museum's board and management hope that many will find the experience of the Industrial Museum to be enlightening.</p>
